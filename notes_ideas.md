## notes and ideas

- ### from gerald: "Sounds good, but not sure how it solves the problem?"

  1. what is the problem exactly?
     - bored at work
     - frustrated/miserable/depressed/ at work
     - feeling the weight of the day/week
     - feeling happy and want to share that feeling
     - thinking of someone fondly
     - want to show how you feel about someone
  2. how do we propose solving that problem?
     - send a person/peer/loved one a quick playlist to express an emotion
       - cheer someone up
       - brighten their day
       - send a love note

- ### need to develop a benefit-driven value proposition

  1. how do we show what the app does?
  2. how does this address the problem?
     - how does it help solve the problem?
     - how does it provide value to the user?
     - how does it make it easier to create a playlist?
       - what are alternatives?
       - what are the steps in creating a playlist and sharing it (without using our app)?
       - how do we make this process easier/better?

- ### should we scrap this idea and brainstorm some more?
